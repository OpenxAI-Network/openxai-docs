## Economic Flywheel

- More **users** lead to more demand for compute  
- More demand leads to **higher burn of $OPENX** through credits  
- More burn creates **scarcity** and increases the **value of holding**  
- More value attracts more **node operators and developers**  
- More operators and developers improve **network capacity and utility**  
- The cycle **reinforces itself** as adoption scales globally
