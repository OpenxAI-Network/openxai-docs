## Native Token Utility

The **$OPENX** token performs multiple functions within the protocol:

### Compute Settlement
All workloads on **Xnodes** are paid in **$OPENX** or tokenized credits.  
Credits such as **tGPU** or **tCPU** are backed by $OPENX and are **redeemed or burned** upon usage.

### Marketplace and Licensing
Models, datasets, and agents in the marketplace are **licensed and monetized** using $OPENX.  
Usage fees, subscriptions, and royalties clear through **smart contracts** that distribute $OPENX to creators and contributors.

### Staking and Rewards
Participants can **stake $OPENX** to support node operators, infrastructure pools, and liquidity vaults.  
Rewards are drawn from **real demand for compute and applications** rather than inflationary emissions.

### Governance
The protocol uses **burn-to-vote governance**.  
Token holders **burn $OPENX** to signal long-term commitment, which grants **voting rights** on proposals, treasury allocations, and protocol upgrades.

### Funding of Ecosystem Projects
Milestone-based funding for builders and research teams is **denominated in $OPENX**.  
Grants and accelerators receive **vesting allocations** that are tied to delivery of measurable outputs.
