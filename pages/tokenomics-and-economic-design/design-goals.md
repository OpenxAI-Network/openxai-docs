## 6.1 Design Goals

The **$OPENX** token is the economic engine of the **OpenxAI Network**.  
Its design follows three principles:

1. Every token must represent real utility in **compute, models, or governance**  
2. Value must flow back to committed participants and **node operators** rather than external investors  
3. Token incentives must create **sustainable growth** without extractive inflation
