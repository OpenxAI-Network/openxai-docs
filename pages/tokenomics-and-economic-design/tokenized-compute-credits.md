## Tokenized Compute Credits

OpenxAI introduces **tokenized compute assets** such as **tGPU** and **tCPU**.

- Credits are **minted** against verified node capacity and cryptographic proofs  
- Credits are **fungible and tradable** across secondary markets  
- Credits are **burned on usage** and provide receipts for settlement  
- They can be **staked** to earn yield from demand for compute  
- They can be **used as collateral** within DeFi systems, creating a **ComputeFi economy**

This system turns **raw compute power** into **programmable liquid capital**.
