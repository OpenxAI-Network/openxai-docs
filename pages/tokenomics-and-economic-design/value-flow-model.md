## Value Flow Model

- **Users** acquire $OPENX to purchase compute credits or access marketplace assets  
- **Credits** are minted and redeemed, consuming $OPENX and **burning supply**  
- **Node operators** receive settlement in $OPENX for workloads executed  
- **Creators and contributors** receive **royalties in $OPENX** through automated distribution  
- The **DAO treasury** accumulates fees, funds new initiatives, and redistributes value to builders and participants  
- **Burn-to-vote governance** ensures that decision-making remains aligned with **long-term holders and contributors**
