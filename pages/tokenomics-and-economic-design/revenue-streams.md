## Revenue Streams

The protocol collects fees across multiple layers:

### Compute Network Fees
Every **GPU or CPU cycle** consumed pays a protocol fee in **$OPENX**.

### Marketplace Fees
**Listing, licensing, and monetization** of models generate recurring fees.

### Royalties and Subscriptions
Built-in **on-chain commerce** ensures that creators and contributors receive revenue,  
while the protocol treasury collects a **percentage for sustainability**.

### DAO Services and Grants
Some specialized services—such as **high-priority inference, storage, or premium datasets**—carry fee flows back to the treasury.
