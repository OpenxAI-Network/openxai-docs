# OpenxAI Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation site for OpenxAI â€” your resource for cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology and best practices. OpenxAI is designed to be compact and focused, providing an efficient guide for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts working in AI.

Our documentation covers everything from how to get started and detailed core features to advanced integration tools and community resources. Explore the sections below to learn more:

### What is OpenxAI Network

OpenxAI Network is the first peer-to-peer permissionless AI protocol. What Bitcoin did for money, OpenxAI does for intelligence. Anyone, anywhere can launch, own, and monetize AI apps, agents, and services fully on-chain. No banks. No corporations. No gatekeepers. Intelligence becomes open, sovereign, unstoppable. GPU compute becomes liquid with tokenized credits (tGPU).

Built by core contributors from Fantom, Solana, ICP, Binance, NEAR, and AragonDAO, OpenxAI runs fully on decentralized infrastructure. It cuts GPU costs by up to 80% compared to AWS and Google, while enabling global AI deployment. Think AWS + Hugging Face + Stripe, rebuilt as a trustless Web3 protocol, open to everyone.

### Vision & Mission

**Vision:**  
To create a borderless AI economy where intelligence flows freely like money.

**Mission:**  
To give anyone the ability to build, deploy, and own AI without centralized infrastructure, corporate capture, or geopolitical restrictions.

---

### The Problem

- Centralized AI controlled by corporations
- Walled gardens limiting access to infrastructure and datasets
- Geopolitical choke points restricting innovation globally
- Exploitative cloud pricing making AI prohibitively expensive

---

### The Solution

OpenxAI is the first **trustless AI protocol**.  
It removes intermediaries, makes compute liquid, and transforms intelligence into an open, permissionless, unstoppable public good.
