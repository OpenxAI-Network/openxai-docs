# Bare Metal Hardware

OpenxAI's infrastructure includes a unique "Sky-Scanner for Bare Metal Providers" that continuously discovers and aggregates dedicated hardware worldwide. This advanced system ensures you always have access to the best available resources for your AI workloads.

## Sky-Scanner for Bare Metal Providers

- **Global Aggregation:**  
  Our platform scans data centers and service providers across the globe, constantly updating a comprehensive database of available bare metal servers.

- **Intelligent Hardware Selection:**  
  By analyzing real-time performance metrics, pricing, geographic location, and energy efficiency, the Sky-Scanner helps you securely select the most suitable hardware for your AI deployments. This ensures not only high performance but also cost-effectiveness and environmental responsibility.

- **Real-Time Monitoring:**  
  The sky-scanner framework delivers real-time updates, ensuring that the information you rely on is always current for optimal deployment decisions.

## Seamless Deployment via OpenxAI Studio

  Deploying AI models is straightforward. OpenxAI Studio integrates directly with the Sky-Scanner, enabling provisioning of the ideal bare metal server with minimal user effort. The deployment process is fast, intuitive, and designed for scalability and reliability.

  The system now supports a broader range of specialized CPUs and GPUs, providing flexibility for diverse AI workloads, including large-scale open-source language models such as LLaMA 2 and Mixtral. Backend optimizations enable faster setup times and more stable deployments.

  Access to high-performance hardware empowers AI solutions to operate efficiently and at scale.
