### Monetization & Tokenization

OpenXAI allows developers to monetize and tokenize their AI models seamlessly, without intermediaries.

### Access Monetization Settings

Once your model is ready to deploy, during the deployment process, configure the monetization and tokenization options.

### Monetization Models

Choose one of the following options:

- **Full Transfer (Sell Entire Model)**  
  Transfer complete ownership of your model, including data, logic, and infrastructure, as a single digital asset.

- **On-Chain SaaS (Subscriptions & Royalties)**  
  Offer your model as a subscription service or usage-based royalty model using smart contracts.

###  Tokenization Options

- Wrap your AI model as an ERC-721 or ERC-6551 token.  
- Allow your model to function as an autonomous economic unit with its own wallet.  
- Define royalty logic (EIP-2981) to automatically pay creators during resale or usage.


### Deploy & Start Earning

1. Upload your model weights or provide an inference URL.  
2. Define pricing logic (flat rate, per token usage, or subscription).  
3. Add optional referral logic and staking tiers.  
4. Click **Deploy**.

Your model will be indexed and available on OpenXAI Studio.  
Users can interact and pay using OPENX tokens.  
All usage is tracked on-chain for transparency.
