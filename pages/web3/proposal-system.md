## Proposal Dashboard

## Creating Proposals

- Gathering support

### Step 2: Formal Submission
Once a proposal has been discussed and refined, it can be submitted through the governance dashboard:
1. Click "Create Proposal"
2. Fill in required details:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Implementation details
   - Timeline
3. Submit for community vote
