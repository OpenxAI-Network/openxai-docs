# Token Utility

The OPENX token provides comprehensive utility across the OpenxAI ecosystem, enabling access to AI resources, governance participation, and economic incentives.

## AI Model Access & Usage
- Pay for AI compute, inference, and API calls using OpenxAI tokens
- Unlock premium AI models and specialized datasets
- Deploy AI models on the decentralized network with staking-based priority access

## AI Model Ownership & Licensing
- Tokenize AI models as NFTs, enabling peer-to-peer sales, leasing, and royalties
- Wrap AI models in smart contracts to allow programmable licensing
- AI developers receive revenue in tokens when their models are used

## Decentralized Compute & Storage Payments
- Pay for distributed GPU and compute power without relying on AWS or Google Cloud
- Users can offer unused GPU power and earn tokens
- Store AI models & datasets on decentralized storage using tokens

## Governance & Voting (DAO Controlled)
- Token holders vote on AI development, network upgrades, and ethical policies
- Decide which AI models are prioritized, funded, or improved
- Prevent corporate or government influence by making AI governance community-led

## Incentives & Rewards
- Developers earn tokens for contributing AI models, data, or compute power
- Users get airdrops for early adoption, governance participation, and referrals
- Validators & node operators earn rewards for securing AI computation & storage

## Crowdfunded AI R&D & Innovation
- Fund AI research & hackathons with milestone-based smart contracts
- Users can back AI development and receive a share of future earnings
- AI challenges (e.g., XPRIZE-style competitions) are funded using OpenxAI tokens

## AI Marketplace & P2P Economy
- Buy, sell, or rent AI models and datasets in a decentralized AI marketplace
- Users pay for custom AI services, like AI-generated content or automation tools
- No middlemenâ€”transactions are direct and trustless

## Network Security & Staking
- Token staking secures the AI network & compute infrastructure
- Validators & service providers stake tokens to offer AI hosting & compute power
- Higher stake = priority access to AI resources
