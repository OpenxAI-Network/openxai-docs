## Core Principles

### Permissionless and Borderless  
OpenxAI is open to anyone, anywhere, anytime.  
There are no accounts, no banks, and no restrictions based on geography or identity.  
The network is designed to function as a neutral public good, accessible equally from Lagos, London, or Lima.  
Just as Bitcoin removed borders for money, OpenxAI removes borders for intelligence.

### Decentralized Infrastructure  
The network is powered by **Xnodes**, a global peer-to-peer compute layer designed specifically for AI.  
Compute and storage are distributed across thousands of independent operators, eliminating reliance on central data centers.  
This ensures resilience, fault tolerance, and continuous uptime, while making compute prices competitive and transparent.

### Community Governance  
OpenxAI belongs to its participants.  
There is no corporate board and no venture capital control.  
All decisions are made through community proposals and on-chain voting.  
Treasury funds, technical upgrades, and growth initiatives are governed directly by token holders who are committed to the protocol.
