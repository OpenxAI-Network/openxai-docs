## 7.5 Hack Nodes

Hack Nodes are a cornerstone of the **OpenxAI community strategy**.  
They act as **decentralized accelerators** that run in universities, research hubs, and local ecosystems.

- **Purpose:** Hack Nodes onboard new developers, host hackathons, and act as **incubation hubs** for permissionless AI projects  
- **Structure:** Each Hack Node is led by a small team of coordinators supported by the DAO. They organize **sprints, provide mentorship**, and distribute compute credits to participants  
- **Funding:** The DAO allocates budget to each Hack Node to cover **infrastructure, prizes, and operational costs**. Milestone reporting ensures accountability and **results-driven funding**  
- **Outcomes:** Hack Nodes have produced hundreds of projects across regions including **Australia, India, and Latin America**. They serve as feeders into the **global marketplace** and **DAO governance process**

Hack Nodes create a **constant pipeline of talent and applications**, proving that OpenxAI is not only a protocol but also a **global movement** for open and permissionless intelligence.
