## Principles of Governance

OpenxAI is governed as a **neutral public protocol**.  

- The system rejects **corporate ownership** and **venture capital control**  
- Power flows directly from **committed participants** who contribute resources, models, or capital  
- Governance is **transparent**, **on-chain**, and designed to **prevent capture** by private or political interests
