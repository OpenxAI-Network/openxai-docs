## Treasury and Allocation

The **DAO treasury** accumulates protocol revenue from multiple sources, including **compute usage, marketplace activity, and specialized services**.  

Treasury funds are allocated to:

- **Grants** for builders, researchers, and community projects  
- **Rewards** for node operators that meet uptime and proof standards  
- **Incentives** for ecosystem partnerships and integrations  
- **Programs** for education, outreach, and developer onboarding  

Every **inflow and outflow** is visible **on-chain**.  
Reports are published periodically to give participants **full transparency** on treasury health and spending
