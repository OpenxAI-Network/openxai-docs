##  Access and Developer Layer

X Studio, SDKs, CLI, and OpenxAI Search.  
This is the entry point for creators and operators.  
It handles wallet connect, project setup, model import, dataset linking, deployment presets, monitoring, and team permissions.  
**OpenxAI Search** lets users find and compare servers across the global fleet.

---

##  Resource and Provider Layer  
Independent operators run **Xnodes**.  
Each Xnode advertises hardware profiles, location, bandwidth, and availability.  
Providers register resources, publish proofs of health, and receive jobs through the scheduler.  
Storage backends and fast networks sit here as first class resources.

---

## Tokenization and Metering Layer  
Compute becomes liquid through **tGPU** and **tCPU** credits.  
Credits are minted against verified capacity and burned on use.  
A metering module records usage with cryptographic receipts.  
These receipts back settlement, refunds, and reputation.  
This layer turns raw infrastructure into a programmable asset.

---

## Orchestration and Price Engine  
The scheduler matches jobs to Xnodes based on price, latency, and policy.  
The global price engine discovers real-time GPU costs and routes workloads to the best regions.  
It supports spot-style placement, reserved capacity, and service level guarantees.  
Autoscaling, failover, and live migrations are handled here.

---

## Execution Runtime Layer  
**X Engine** runs training, fine tuning, and inference inside reproducible containers.  
It supports agent runtimes, function calling, streaming, and multi-model graphs.  
Workloads are launched wallet to wallet without central servers.  
Geographic routing ensures requests land close to users.

---

## Intelligence Registry Layer  
Models, datasets, prompts, and agents are tokenized as on-chain assets.  
Versioning, provenance, capability tags, and licensing terms are recorded.  
Composability allows apps to reuse and remix assets while preserving credit for creators and enforcing royalties.

---

## Commerce and Settlement Layer  
Subscriptions, usage-based billing, and revenue share run through smart contracts.  
Payments clear in **OPENX** and accepted stable assets.  
Royalties are split automatically to owners and collaborators.  
Cross-chain settlement is available for Base, BNB, and Solana through audited bridges and messaging.

---

## Trust and Governance Layer  
Staking, slashing, proofs of work integrity, and provider reputation maintain network quality.  
Neutrality rules prevent jurisdictional capture.  
The DAO controls upgrades, treasury programs, and incentive design.  
Burn to vote aligns influence with long-term commitment.
